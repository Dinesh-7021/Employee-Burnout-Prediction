#Employee-Burnout-Prediction

# 🔥 Employee Burnout Analysis & Prediction 🏢💻  

A **machine learning-powered predictive model** that identifies early signs of **employee burnout**, providing organizations with data-driven insights for proactive intervention.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Employee burnout is a critical workplace issue affecting productivity, mental well-being, and organizational efficiency. This project leverages **data science and machine learning** to analyze burnout patterns and predict high-risk cases based on key workplace factors.  

By analyzing parameters such as **workload, work-life balance, job satisfaction, and mental fatigue**, this model helps companies take **preventive measures** to improve employee retention and well-being.

## 🔥 Key Features  
✅ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleans, transforms, and normalizes datasets for accuracy  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Detects burnout trends using statistical and visualization techniques  
✅ **Predictive Modeling** – Implements **Linear Regression** and **MLP Regressor** for burnout prediction  
✅ **Performance Evaluation** – Uses **MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² scores** to assess model accuracy  
✅ **Real-World Application** – Helps HR professionals implement strategic interventions for burnout prevention
